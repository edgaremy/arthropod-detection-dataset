INDIVIDUAL SCENARIO CONTRIBUTIONS (Pearson):
(How each scenario contributes to predicting image count - linear)

   ArthroNat_F1 : β = -51.5293 (p = 0.6753 ) 
   flatbug_F1 : β = 28.3085 (p = 0.5014 ) 
   ArthroNat.flatbug_F1 : β =  3.0702 (p = 0.9827 )

   ArthroNat.mosaic4x4_F1 : β = 20.8175 (p = 0.7737 ) 
   ArthroNat.no.mosaic_F1 : β = 41.8562 (p = 0.4484 ) 

INDIVIDUAL SCENARIO CONTRIBUTIONS (Spearman):
(How each scenario contributes to predicting image count - monotonic)

   ArthroNat_F1 : β = -0.4505 (p = 0.0640 ) 
   flatbug_F1 : β =  0.0579 (p = 0.7150 )

   ArthroNat.no.mosaic_F1 : β =  0.4507 (p = 0.0262 ) *

INTERPRETATION:
  Pearson analysis: WEAK linear correlation (R = 0.194 , 3.7% variance explained)
  Spearman analysis: MODERATE monotonic correlation (R = 0.492 , 24.2% variance explained)
  Stronger relationship detected by: Spearman (monotonic)
  → Only MONOTONIC relationship is statistically significant

STATISTICAL NOTES:
  * indicates statistical significance (p < 0.05)
  Pearson: measures linear relationships (traditional multiple correlation)
  Spearman: measures monotonic relationships (robust to outliers and non-linearity)
  Multiple R measures how well all scenarios together correlate with image count
  R-squared shows the percentage of variance explained by the scenarios
  Adjusted R-squared adjusts for the number of variables (prevents overfitting)
  β coefficients show individual scenario contributions
  Correlation strength: R < 0.3 (weak), 0.3-0.7 (moderate), > 0.7 (strong)
  Agreement level: HIGH (diff < 0.1), MODERATE (0.1-0.2), LOW (> 0.2)
