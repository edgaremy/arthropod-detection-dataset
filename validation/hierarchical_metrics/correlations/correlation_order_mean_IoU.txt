   ArthroNat.no.mosaic_mean_IoU : β = 35.6800 (p = 0.6254 ) 

INDIVIDUAL SCENARIO CONTRIBUTIONS (Spearman):
(How each scenario contributes to predicting image count - monotonic)

   ArthroNat_mean_IoU : β = -0.1312 (p = 0.5486 ) 
   flatbug_mean_IoU : β = -0.0240 (p = 0.9014 )

INTERPRETATION:
  Pearson analysis: WEAK linear correlation (R = 0.264 , 7.0% variance explained)
  Spearman analysis: WEAK monotonic correlation (R = 0.287 , 8.3% variance explained)
  Stronger relationship detected by: Spearman (monotonic)
  → Neither relationship is statistically significant

STATISTICAL NOTES:
  * indicates statistical significance (p < 0.05)
  Pearson: measures linear relationships (traditional multiple correlation)
  Spearman: measures monotonic relationships (robust to outliers and non-linearity)
  Multiple R measures how well all scenarios together correlate with image count
  R-squared shows the percentage of variance explained by the scenarios
  Adjusted R-squared adjusts for the number of variables (prevents overfitting)
  β coefficients show individual scenario contributions
  Correlation strength: R < 0.3 (weak), 0.3-0.7 (moderate), > 0.7 (strong)
  Agreement level: HIGH (diff < 0.1), MODERATE (0.1-0.2), LOW (> 0.2)
