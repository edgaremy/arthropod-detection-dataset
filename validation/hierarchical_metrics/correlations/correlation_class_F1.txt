  Agreement level: LOW

INDIVIDUAL SCENARIO CONTRIBUTIONS (Pearson):
(How each scenario contributes to predicting image count - linear)

   ArthroNat_F1 : β = 4704.4832 (p = 0.7736 ) 
   flatbug_F1 : β = 987.1889 (p = 0.6968 ) 
   ArthroNat.flatbug_F1 : β = -2188.8040 (p = 0.8584 ) 
   ArthroNat.mosaic3x3_F1 : β = -1099.1394 (p = 0.8618 ) 
   ArthroNat.mosaic4x4_F1 : β = -1852.2886 (p = 0.7496 ) 
   ArthroNat.no.mosaic_F1 : β = -580.9199 (p = 0.8937 ) 

INDIVIDUAL SCENARIO CONTRIBUTIONS (Spearman):
(How each scenario contributes to predicting image count - monotonic)

   ArthroNat_F1 : β =  0.1072 (p = 0.9445 ) 
   flatbug_F1 : β = -0.0750 (p = 0.9331 ) 
   ArthroNat.flatbug_F1 : β = -0.5804 (p = 0.6016 ) 
   ArthroNat.mosaic3x3_F1 : β = -0.6271 (p = 0.4141 ) 
   ArthroNat.mosaic4x4_F1 : β = -0.0288 (p = 0.9820 ) 
   ArthroNat.no.mosaic_F1 : β =  0.6721 (p = 0.4779 ) 

INTERPRETATION:
  Pearson analysis: MODERATE linear correlation (R = 0.325 , 10.6% variance explained)
  Spearman analysis: STRONG monotonic correlation (R = 0.808 , 65.2% variance explained)
  Stronger relationship detected by: Spearman (monotonic)
  → Neither relationship is statistically significant

STATISTICAL NOTES:
  * indicates statistical significance (p < 0.05)
  Pearson: measures linear relationships (traditional multiple correlation)
  Spearman: measures monotonic relationships (robust to outliers and non-linearity)
  Multiple R measures how well all scenarios together correlate with image count
  R-squared shows the percentage of variance explained by the scenarios
  Adjusted R-squared adjusts for the number of variables (prevents overfitting)
  β coefficients show individual scenario contributions
  Correlation strength: R < 0.3 (weak), 0.3-0.7 (moderate), > 0.7 (strong)
  Agreement level: HIGH (diff < 0.1), MODERATE (0.1-0.2), LOW (> 0.2)
