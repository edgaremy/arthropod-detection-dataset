INDIVIDUAL SCENARIO CONTRIBUTIONS (Pearson):
(How each scenario contributes to predicting image count - linear)

   ArthroNat_mean_IoU : β = 910.7847 (p = 0.9753 ) 
   flatbug_mean_IoU : β = 776.6811 (p = 0.8916 ) 
   ArthroNat.flatbug_mean_IoU : β = -3765.0516 (p = 0.8752 ) 
   ArthroNat.mosaic3x3_mean_IoU : β = -302.1306 (p = 0.9850 ) 
   ArthroNat.mosaic4x4_mean_IoU : β = 2148.3927 (p = 0.8258 ) 
   ArthroNat.no.mosaic_mean_IoU : β = 694.5232 (p = 0.9372 ) 

INDIVIDUAL SCENARIO CONTRIBUTIONS (Spearman):
(How each scenario contributes to predicting image count - monotonic)

   ArthroNat_mean_IoU : β = -2.3094 (p = 0.4162 ) 
   flatbug_mean_IoU : β = -1.3054 (p = 0.1756 ) 
   ArthroNat.flatbug_mean_IoU : β =  1.3273 (p = 0.4217 )

   ArthroNat.mosaic4x4_mean_IoU : β =  0.7909 (p = 0.3117 ) 
   ArthroNat.no.mosaic_mean_IoU : β =  2.5254 (p = 0.2410 ) 

INTERPRETATION:
  Pearson analysis: MODERATE linear correlation (R = 0.338 , 11.4% variance explained)
  Spearman analysis: STRONG monotonic correlation (R = 0.842 , 71.0% variance explained)
  Stronger relationship detected by: Spearman (monotonic)
  → Neither relationship is statistically significant

STATISTICAL NOTES:
  * indicates statistical significance (p < 0.05)
  Pearson: measures linear relationships (traditional multiple correlation)
  Spearman: measures monotonic relationships (robust to outliers and non-linearity)
  Multiple R measures how well all scenarios together correlate with image count
  R-squared shows the percentage of variance explained by the scenarios
  Adjusted R-squared adjusts for the number of variables (prevents overfitting)
  β coefficients show individual scenario contributions
  Correlation strength: R < 0.3 (weak), 0.3-0.7 (moderate), > 0.7 (strong)
  Agreement level: HIGH (diff < 0.1), MODERATE (0.1-0.2), LOW (> 0.2)
